## üìñ Overview

This repository declares all of my infrastructure and Kubernetes clusters, both self-hosted and in [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/). I also host all of my documentation here.

Admittedly, both usages of "all" describe the end goal of this repo, not the current state. But, I will get there some day.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Dependencies

Although the majority of my infrastructure and workloads are self-hosted, there are certain key components of my setup that rely on cloud services.

## ü§ù Thanks

Over time I've taken a ton of inspiration from the K8s@Home / home-ops community: [onedr0p](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template), [szinn](https://github.com/szinn/k8s-homelab), [budimanjojo](https://github.com/budimanjojo/home-cluster), [buroa](https://github.com/buroa/k8s-gitops), [coolguy1771](https://github.com/coolguy1771/home-ops), and many others.

Technically however, I hope this repo is quite unique. I've intentionally tried to make some uncommon choices to learn more and venture outside my comfort zone a bit. So, I hope that in the very least, this repo will provide anyone looking with some interesting and unique ideas. üôÇ

## üîè License

This project is licensed under the Apache-2.0 license, primarily because it's very compatible with a lot of the projects I enjoy stealing code from.

For more details, see [LICENSE](./LICENSE).

Ultimately though, I have a WTFPL mindset about any content produced by/for myself. If you like anything you see here, feel free to use it however you want (yes, that includes the peepos), just don't sue me if my code blows up your cluster. If you're feeling especially nice, links back to this repo are always appreciated (for the SEO, or whatever).
