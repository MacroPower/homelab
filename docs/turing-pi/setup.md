# Setup

## Static MAC

By default the Turing Pi uses DHCP with a random MAC address, which changes on every reboot.

To set a static MAC address, add the following to `/etc/network/interfaces`:

```diff
# interface file auto-generated by buildroot

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
+ hwaddress ether <MAC Address>
  pre-up /etc/network/nfs_check
  wait-delay 15
  hostname $(hostname)
```

```sh
ifdown eth0 && ifup eth0
```

Then I configured a static DHCP lease for that MAC address, since that's my personal preference for managing IP address and other network configuration.
