# Talos

To flash Talos, get an image here:

https://factory.talos.dev/

Choose the `rpi_generic` overlay for CM4.

Make sure to download the `arm64 metal disk image`. It should be a .raw.xz file.

Extract the .raw and rename it to .img.

You can use this .img to flash the node using the Turing Pi's web UI.
