    fsGroup : int, default is Undefined, optional
        A special supplemental group that applies to all containers in a pod.
        Some volume types allow the Kubelet to change the ownership of that volume
        to be owned by the pod:

        1. The owning GID will be the FSGroup
        2. The setgid bit is set (new files created in the volume will be owned by FSGroup)
        3. The permission bits are OR'd with rw-rw----

        If unset, the Kubelet will not modify the ownership and permissions of any volume.
        Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
    fsGroupChangePolicy : str, default is Undefined, optional
        fsGroupChangePolicy defines behavior of changing ownership and permission of the volume
        before being exposed inside Pod. This field will only apply to
        volume types which support fsGroup based ownership(and permissions).
        It will have no effect on ephemeral volume types such as: secret, configmaps
        and emptydir.
        Valid values are "OnRootMismatch" and "Always". If not specified, "Always" is used.
        Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
    runAsGroup : int, default is Undefined, optional
        The GID to run the entrypoint of the container process.
        Uses runtime default if unset.
        May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and

        for that container.
        Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
    runAsNonRoot : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user.
        If true, the Kubelet will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it
        does not run as UID 0 (root) and fail to start the container if it does.
        If unset or false, no such validation will be performed.
        May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and
        PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.
    runAsUser : int, default is Undefined, optional
        The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process.
        Defaults to user specified in image metadata if unspecified.
        May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and
        PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence
        for that container.
        Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
    seLinuxChangePolicy : str, default is Undefined, optional
        seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
        It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
        Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

        "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
        This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

        "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
        This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
        It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
        Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
        whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
        CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
        "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

        If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
        If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
        and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

        This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

        All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

    supplementalGroups : [int], default is Undefined, optional
        A list of groups applied to the first process run in each container, in

        the SupplementalGroupsPolicy feature is enabled, the
        supplementalGroupsPolicy field determines whether these are in addition
        to or instead of any group memberships defined in the container image.
        If unspecified, no additional groups are added, though group memberships
        defined in the container image may still be used, depending on the
        supplementalGroupsPolicy field.
        Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
    supplementalGroupsPolicy : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Defines how supplemental groups of the first container processes are calculated.
        Valid values are "Merge" and "Strict". If not specified, "Merge" is used.

        Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
    runAsNonRoot : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user.
        If true, the Kubelet will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it
        does not run as UID 0 (root) and fail to start the container if it does.
        If unset or false, no such validation will be performed.
        May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and
        PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.
    runAsUser : int, default is Undefined, optional
        The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process.
        Defaults to user specified in image metadata if unspecified.
        May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and
        PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence
        for that container.
        Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
    seLinuxChangePolicy : str, default is Undefined, optional
        seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
        It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
        Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

        "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
        This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

        "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
        This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
        It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
        Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
        whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
        CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
        "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

        If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
        If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
        and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

        This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

        All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.
        Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.

        supplementalGroupsPolicy field determines whether these are in addition

        It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
        Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

        "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
        This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

        "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
        This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
        It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
        Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
        whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
        CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
