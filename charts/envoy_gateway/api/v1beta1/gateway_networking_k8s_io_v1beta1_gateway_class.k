schema GatewayClass:
    r"""
    GatewayClass describes a class of Gateways available to the user for creating
    Gateway resources.

    It is recommended that this resource be used as a template for Gateways. This
    means that a Gateway is based on the state of the GatewayClass at the time it
    was created and changes to the GatewayClass or associated parameters are not
    propagated down to existing Gateways. This recommendation is intended to
    limit the blast radius of changes to GatewayClass or associated parameters.
    If implementations choose to propagate GatewayClass changes to existing
    Gateways, that MUST be clearly documented by the implementation.

    Whenever one or more Gateways are using a GatewayClass, implementations SHOULD
    add the `gateway-exists-finalizer.gateway.networking.k8s.io` finalizer on the
    associated GatewayClass. This ensures that a GatewayClass associated with a
    Gateway is not deleted while in use.

    GatewayClass is a Cluster level resource.

schema GatewayNetworkingK8sIoV1beta1GatewayClassSpecParametersRef:
    r"""
    ParametersRef is a reference to a resource that contains the configuration
    parameters corresponding to the GatewayClass. This is optional if the
    controller does not require any additional configuration.

    ParametersRef can reference a standard Kubernetes resource, i.e. ConfigMap,
    or an implementation-specific custom resource. The resource can be
    cluster-scoped or namespace-scoped.

    If the referent cannot be found, refers to an unsupported kind, or when
    the data within that resource is malformed, the GatewayClass SHOULD be
    rejected with the "Accepted" status condition set to "False" and an
    "InvalidParameters" reason.

    A Gateway for this GatewayClass may provide its own `parametersRef`. When both are specified,
    the merging behavior is implementation specific.
    It is generally recommended that GatewayClass provides defaults that can be overridden by a Gateway.
