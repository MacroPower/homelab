    r"""
    HTTPRoute provides a way to route HTTP requests. This includes the capability
    to match requests by hostname, path, header, or query param. Filters can be
    used to specify additional processing steps. Backends specify where matching
    requests should be routed.

    Attributes
    ----------
    hostnames : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        Hostnames defines a set of hostnames that should match against the HTTP Host
        header to select a HTTPRoute used to process the request. Implementations
        MUST ignore any port value specified in the HTTP Host header while
        performing a match and (absent of any applicable header modification
        configuration) MUST forward this header unmodified to the backend.

        Valid values for Hostnames are determined by RFC 1123 definition of a
        hostname with 2 notable exceptions:

        1. IPs are not allowed.
        2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
           label must appear by itself as the first label.

        If a hostname is specified by both the Listener and HTTPRoute, there
        must be at least one intersecting hostname for the HTTPRoute to be
        attached to the Listener. For example:

        * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
          that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at
          least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.
        * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
          that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least
          one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,
          `*.example.com`, `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com` would
          all match. On the other hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would
          not match.

        Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
        as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
        both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.

        If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any
        HTTPRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be
        ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the
        HTTPRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,
        `test.example.net` must not be considered for a match.

        If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, and none
        match with the criteria above, then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The
        implementation must raise an 'Accepted' Condition with a status of
        `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.

        In the event that multiple HTTPRoutes specify intersecting hostnames (e.g.
        overlapping wildcard matching and exact matching hostnames), precedence must
        be given to rules from the HTTPRoute with the largest number of:

        * Characters in a matching non-wildcard hostname.
        * Characters in a matching hostname.

        If ties exist across multiple Routes, the matching precedence rules for
        HTTPRouteMatches takes over.

    parentRefs : [GatewayNetworkingK8sIoV1beta1HTTPRouteSpecParentRefsItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
        to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
        allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
        the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
        namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
        namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
        and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
        not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
        create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
        Route.

        There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:

        * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
        * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

        This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
        resources.

        ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:

        * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
          entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
          multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
          be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
        * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
          each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
          optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
          combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.

        Some examples:

        * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
          same object must also set `sectionName`.
        * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
          object must also set `port`.
        * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
          referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.

        It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
        be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
        choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
        case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
        merged.

        Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
        rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
        allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
        Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
        generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.


        ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
        routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
        any namespace to the Service.

        ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
        "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
        connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
        the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
        ParentRef of the Route.
    rules : [GatewayNetworkingK8sIoV1beta1HTTPRouteSpecRulesItems0], default is [{"matches": [{"path": {"type": "PathPrefix", "value": "/"}}]}], optional
        Rules are a list of HTTP matchers, filters and actions.
    useDefaultGateways : str, default is Undefined, optional
        UseDefaultGateways indicates the default Gateway scope to use for this
        Route. If unset (the default) or set to None, the Route will not be
        attached to any default Gateway; if set, it will be attached to any
        default Gateway supporting the named scope, subject to the usual rules
        about which Routes a Gateway is allowed to claim.

        Think carefully before using this functionality! The set of default
        Gateways supporting the requested scope can change over time without
        any notice to the Route author, and in many situations it will not be
        appropriate to request a default Gateway for a given Route -- for
        example, a Route with specific security requirements should almost
        certainly not use a default Gateway.

    ParentReference identifies an API object (usually a Gateway) that can be considered
    a parent of this resource (usually a route). There are two kinds of parent resources
    with "Core" support:

    * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
    * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

    This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
    resources.

    The API object must be valid in the cluster; the Group and Kind must
    be registered in the cluster for this reference to be valid.

    group : str, default is "gateway.networking.k8s.io", optional
        Group is the group of the referent.
        When unspecified, "gateway.networking.k8s.io" is inferred.

    name : str, default is Undefined, required
        Name is the name of the referent.

        Support: Core
    namespace : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Namespace is the namespace of the referent. When unspecified, this refers
        to the local namespace of the Route.

        Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
        boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
        allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
        Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
        generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

        Support: Core
    port : int, default is Undefined, optional
        Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
        differently based on the type of parent resource.

        When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
        listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
        select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
        networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
        as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
        and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
        must match both specified values.


        When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
        Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
        the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.


        Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
        Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
        document how/if Port is interpreted.

        For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
        long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
        from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
        attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
        the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

        Support: Extended
    sectionName : str, default is Undefined, optional
        SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the
        following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:

        * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
        are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
        both specified values.
        * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
        are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
        both specified values.

        Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
        If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
        interpreted.

        When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
        For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
        least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
        the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
        attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
        Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

    r"""
    HTTPRouteRule defines semantics for matching an HTTP request based on
    conditions (matches), processing it (filters), and forwarding the request to
    an API object (backendRefs).

    Attributes
    ----------
    backendRefs : [GatewayNetworkingK8sIoV1beta1HTTPRouteSpecRulesItems0BackendRefsItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        BackendRefs defines the backend(s) where matching requests should be
        sent.

        Failure behavior here depends on how many BackendRefs are specified and
        how many are invalid.

        If *all* entries in BackendRefs are invalid, and there are also no filters
        specified in this route rule, *all* traffic which matches this rule MUST
        receive a 500 status code.

        See the HTTPBackendRef definition for the rules about what makes a single
        HTTPBackendRef invalid.

        When a HTTPBackendRef is invalid, 500 status codes MUST be returned for
        requests that would have otherwise been routed to an invalid backend. If
        multiple backends are specified, and some are invalid, the proportion of
        requests that would otherwise have been routed to an invalid backend
        MUST receive a 500 status code.

        For example, if two backends are specified with equal weights, and one is
        invalid, 50 percent of traffic must receive a 500. Implementations may
        choose how that 50 percent is determined.

        When a HTTPBackendRef refers to a Service that has no ready endpoints,
        implementations SHOULD return a 503 for requests to that backend instead.
        If an implementation chooses to do this, all of the above rules for 500 responses
        MUST also apply for responses that return a 503.

    filters : [GatewayNetworkingK8sIoV1beta1HTTPRouteSpecRulesItems0FiltersItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        Filters define the filters that are applied to requests that match
        this rule.

        Wherever possible, implementations SHOULD implement filters in the order
        they are specified.

        Implementations MAY choose to implement this ordering strictly, rejecting
        any combination or order of filters that cannot be supported. If implementations
        choose a strict interpretation of filter ordering, they MUST clearly document
        that behavior.

        To reject an invalid combination or order of filters, implementations SHOULD
        consider the Route Rules with this configuration invalid. If all Route Rules
        in a Route are invalid, the entire Route would be considered invalid. If only
        a portion of Route Rules are invalid, implementations MUST set the
        "PartiallyInvalid" condition for the Route.

        Conformance-levels at this level are defined based on the type of filter:

        - ALL core filters MUST be supported by all implementations.
        - Implementers are encouraged to support extended filters.
        - Implementation-specific custom filters have no API guarantees across
          implementations.

        Specifying the same filter multiple times is not supported unless explicitly
        indicated in the filter.

        All filters are expected to be compatible with each other except for the
        URLRewrite and RequestRedirect filters, which may not be combined. If an
        implementation cannot support other combinations of filters, they must clearly
        document that limitation. In cases where incompatible or unsupported
        filters are specified and cause the `Accepted` condition to be set to status
        `False`, implementations may use the `IncompatibleFilters` reason to specify
        this configuration error.

    matches : [GatewayNetworkingK8sIoV1beta1HTTPRouteSpecRulesItems0MatchesItems0], default is [{"path": {"value": "/", "type": "PathPrefix"}}], optional
        Matches define conditions used for matching the rule against incoming
        HTTP requests. Each match is independent, i.e. this rule will be matched
        if **any** one of the matches is satisfied.

        For example, take the following matches configuration:

        ```
        matches:
        - path:
            value: "/foo"
          headers:
          - name: "version"
            value: "v2"
        - path:
            value: "/v2/foo"
        ```

        For a request to match against this rule, a request must satisfy
        EITHER of the two conditions:

        - path prefixed with `/foo` AND contains the header `version: v2`
        - path prefix of `/v2/foo`

        See the documentation for HTTPRouteMatch on how to specify multiple
        match conditions that should be ANDed together.

        If no matches are specified, the default is a prefix
        path match on "/", which has the effect of matching every
        HTTP request.

        Proxy or Load Balancer routing configuration generated from HTTPRoutes
        MUST prioritize matches based on the following criteria, continuing on
        ties. Across all rules specified on applicable Routes, precedence must be
        given to the match having:

        * "Exact" path match.
        * "Prefix" path match with largest number of characters.
        * Method match.
        * Largest number of header matches.
        * Largest number of query param matches.

        Note: The precedence of RegularExpression path matches are implementation-specific.

        If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be
        determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:

        * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
        * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
          "{namespace}/{name}".

        If ties still exist within an HTTPRoute, matching precedence MUST be granted
        to the FIRST matching rule (in list order) with a match meeting the above
        criteria.

        When no rules matching a request have been successfully attached to the
        parent a request is coming from, a HTTP 404 status code MUST be returned.

    HTTPBackendRef defines how a HTTPRoute forwards a HTTP request.

    Note that when a namespace different than the local namespace is specified, a
    ReferenceGrant object is required in the referent namespace to allow that
    namespace's owner to accept the reference. See the ReferenceGrant
    documentation for details.


    When the BackendRef points to a Kubernetes Service, implementations SHOULD
    honor the appProtocol field if it is set for the target Service Port.

    Implementations supporting appProtocol SHOULD recognize the Kubernetes
    Standard Application Protocols defined in KEP-3726.

    If a Service appProtocol isn't specified, an implementation MAY infer the
    backend protocol through its own means. Implementations MAY infer the
    protocol from the Route type referring to the backend Service.

    If a Route is not able to send traffic to the backend using the specified
    protocol then the backend is considered invalid. Implementations MUST set the
    "ResolvedRefs" condition to "False" with the "UnsupportedProtocol" reason.

        Kind is the Kubernetes resource kind of the referent. For example
        "Service".

        Defaults to "Service" when not specified.

        ExternalName services can refer to CNAME DNS records that may live
        outside of the cluster and as such are difficult to reason about in
        terms of conformance. They also may not be safe to forward to (see

        Namespace is the namespace of the backend. When unspecified, the local
        namespace is inferred.

        Note that when a namespace different than the local namespace is specified,
        a ReferenceGrant object is required in the referent namespace to allow that
        namespace's owner to accept the reference. See the ReferenceGrant

    port : int, default is Undefined, optional
        Port specifies the destination port number to use for this resource.
        Port is required when the referent is a Kubernetes Service. In this
        case, the port number is the service port number, not the target port.
        For other resources, destination port might be derived from the referent
        resource or this field.
    weight : int, default is 1, optional
        Weight specifies the proportion of requests forwarded to the referenced
        backend. This is computed as weight/(sum of all weights in this
        BackendRefs list). For non-zero values, there may be some epsilon from
        the exact proportion defined here depending on the precision an
        implementation supports. Weight is not a percentage and the sum of
        weights does not need to equal 100.

        If only one backend is specified and it has a weight greater than 0, 100%
        of the traffic is forwarded to that backend. If weight is set to 0, no
        traffic should be forwarded for this entry. If unspecified, weight
        defaults to 1.

        Support for this field varies based on the context where used.

        Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
        types are classified into three conformance levels:

        - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
          "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
          implementations must support core filters.

        - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
          "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
          are encouraged to support extended filters.

        - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
          specific vendors.
          In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
          implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
          conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
          is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
          "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.

        Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
        extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

        If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
        MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
        that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

        Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
        must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.

        Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the

        Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.

    CORS defines a schema for a filter that responds to the
    cross-origin request based on HTTP response header.

    Support: Extended

    Attributes
    ----------
    allowCredentials : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        AllowCredentials indicates whether the actual cross-origin request allows
        to include credentials.

        When set to true, the gateway will include the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`
        response header with value true (case-sensitive).

        When set to false or omitted the gateway will omit the header
        `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` entirely (this is the standard CORS
        behavior).

        Support: Extended
    allowHeaders : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        AllowHeaders indicates which HTTP request headers are supported for
        accessing the requested resource.

        Header names are not case sensitive.

        Multiple header names in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`
        response header are separated by a comma (",").

        When the `AllowHeaders` field is configured with one or more headers, the
        gateway must return the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header
        which value is present in the `AllowHeaders` field.

        If any header name in the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` request header
        is not included in the list of header names specified by the response
        header `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`, it will present an error on the
        client side.

        If any header name in the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header
        does not recognize by the client, it will also occur an error on the
        client side.

        A wildcard indicates that the requests with all HTTP headers are allowed.
        The `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header can only use `*`
        wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

        When the `AllowCredentials` field is true and `AllowHeaders` field
        specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must specify one or more
        HTTP headers in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response
        header. The value of the header `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` is same as
        the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header provided by the client. If
        the header `Access-Control-Request-Headers` is not included in the
        request, the gateway will omit the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`
        response header, instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. A Gateway
        implementation may choose to add implementation-specific default headers.

        Support: Extended
    allowMethods : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        AllowMethods indicates which HTTP methods are supported for accessing the
        requested resource.

        Valid values are any method defined by RFC9110, along with the special
        value `*`, which represents all HTTP methods are allowed.

        Method names are case sensitive, so these values are also case-sensitive.
        (See https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616#section-5.1.1)

        Multiple method names in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`
        response header are separated by a comma (",").

        A CORS-safelisted method is a method that is `GET`, `HEAD`, or `POST`.
        (See https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-safelisted-method) The
        CORS-safelisted methods are always allowed, regardless of whether they
        are specified in the `AllowMethods` field.

        When the `AllowMethods` field is configured with one or more methods, the
        gateway must return the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header
        which value is present in the `AllowMethods` field.

        If the HTTP method of the `Access-Control-Request-Method` request header
        is not included in the list of methods specified by the response header
        `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, it will present an error on the client
        side.

        The `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header can only use `*`
        wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

        When the `AllowCredentials` field is true and `AllowMethods` field
        specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must specify one HTTP method
        in the value of the Access-Control-Allow-Methods response header. The
        value of the header `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` is same as the
        `Access-Control-Request-Method` header provided by the client. If the
        header `Access-Control-Request-Method` is not included in the request,
        the gateway will omit the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header,
        instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. A Gateway implementation may
        choose to add implementation-specific default methods.

        Support: Extended
    allowOrigins : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        AllowOrigins indicates whether the response can be shared with requested
        resource from the given `Origin`.

        The `Origin` consists of a scheme and a host, with an optional port, and
        takes the form `<scheme>://<host>(:<port>)`.

        Valid values for scheme are: `http` and `https`.

        Valid values for port are any integer between 1 and 65535 (the list of
        available TCP/UDP ports). Note that, if not included, port `80` is
        assumed for `http` scheme origins, and port `443` is assumed for `https`
        origins. This may affect origin matching.

        The host part of the origin may contain the wildcard character `*`. These
        wildcard characters behave as follows:

        * `*` is a greedy match to the _left_, including any number of
          DNS labels to the left of its position. This also means that
          `*` will include any number of period `.` characters to the
          left of its position.
        * A wildcard by itself matches all hosts.

        An origin value that includes _only_ the `*` character indicates requests
        from all `Origin`s are allowed.

        When the `AllowOrigins` field is configured with multiple origins, it
        means the server supports clients from multiple origins. If the request
        `Origin` matches the configured allowed origins, the gateway must return
        the given `Origin` and sets value of the header
        `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` same as the `Origin` header provided by the
        client.

        The status code of a successful response to a "preflight" request is
        always an OK status (i.e., 204 or 200).

        If the request `Origin` does not match the configured allowed origins,
        the gateway returns 204/200 response but doesn't set the relevant
        cross-origin response headers. Alternatively, the gateway responds with
        403 status to the "preflight" request is denied, coupled with omitting
        the CORS headers. The cross-origin request fails on the client side.
        Therefore, the client doesn't attempt the actual cross-origin request.

        The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header can only use `*`
        wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

        When the `AllowCredentials` field is true and `AllowOrigins` field
        specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must return a single origin
        in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header,
        instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. The value of the header
        `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is same as the `Origin` header provided by
        the client.

        Support: Extended
    exposeHeaders : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        ExposeHeaders indicates which HTTP response headers can be exposed
        to client-side scripts in response to a cross-origin request.

        A CORS-safelisted response header is an HTTP header in a CORS response
        that it is considered safe to expose to the client scripts.
        The CORS-safelisted response headers include the following headers:
        `Cache-Control`
        `Content-Language`
        `Content-Length`
        `Content-Type`
        `Expires`
        `Last-Modified`
        `Pragma`
        (See https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-safelisted-response-header-name)
        The CORS-safelisted response headers are exposed to client by default.

        When an HTTP header name is specified using the `ExposeHeaders` field,
        this additional header will be exposed as part of the response to the
        client.

        Header names are not case sensitive.

        Multiple header names in the value of the `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`
        response header are separated by a comma (",").

        A wildcard indicates that the responses with all HTTP headers are exposed
        to clients. The `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` response header can only
        use `*` wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

        Support: Extended
    maxAge : int, default is 5, optional
        MaxAge indicates the duration (in seconds) for the client to cache the
        results of a "preflight" request.

        The information provided by the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` and
        `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response headers can be cached by the
        client until the time specified by `Access-Control-Max-Age` elapses.

        The default value of `Access-Control-Max-Age` response header is 5
        (seconds).

    It is expected that implementations will buffer the request body up to
    `forwardBody.maxSize` bytes. Bodies over that size must be rejected with a
    4xx series error (413 or 403 are common examples), and fail processing

        If this list is empty, then only those headers must be sent.

        Note that `Content-Length` has a special behavior, in that the length
        sent must be correct for the actual request to the external authorization
        server - that is, it must reflect the actual number of bytes sent in the
        body of the request to the authorization server.

        So if the `forwardBody` stanza is unset, or `forwardBody.maxSize` is set

          "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
          implementations must support core filters.

        - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
          "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
          are encouraged to support extended filters.

        - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
          specific vendors.
          In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
          implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
          conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
          is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
          "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.

        Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
        extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

        If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
        MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
        that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

    Attributes
    ----------
    allowCredentials : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        AllowCredentials indicates whether the actual cross-origin request allows
        to include credentials.

        When set to true, the gateway will include the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`
        response header with value true (case-sensitive).

        When set to false or omitted the gateway will omit the header
        `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` entirely (this is the standard CORS
        behavior).

        Support: Extended
    allowHeaders : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        AllowHeaders indicates which HTTP request headers are supported for
        accessing the requested resource.

        Header names are not case sensitive.

        Multiple header names in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`
        response header are separated by a comma (",").

        When the `AllowHeaders` field is configured with one or more headers, the
        gateway must return the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header
        which value is present in the `AllowHeaders` field.

        If any header name in the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` request header
        is not included in the list of header names specified by the response
        header `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`, it will present an error on the
        client side.

        If any header name in the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header
        does not recognize by the client, it will also occur an error on the
        client side.

        A wildcard indicates that the requests with all HTTP headers are allowed.
        The `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header can only use `*`
        wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

        When the `AllowCredentials` field is true and `AllowHeaders` field
        specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must specify one or more
        HTTP headers in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response
        header. The value of the header `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` is same as
        the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header provided by the client. If
        the header `Access-Control-Request-Headers` is not included in the
        request, the gateway will omit the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`
        response header, instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. A Gateway
        implementation may choose to add implementation-specific default headers.

        Support: Extended
    allowMethods : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        AllowMethods indicates which HTTP methods are supported for accessing the
        requested resource.

        Valid values are any method defined by RFC9110, along with the special
        value `*`, which represents all HTTP methods are allowed.

        Method names are case sensitive, so these values are also case-sensitive.
        (See https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616#section-5.1.1)

        Multiple method names in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`
        response header are separated by a comma (",").

        A CORS-safelisted method is a method that is `GET`, `HEAD`, or `POST`.
        (See https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-safelisted-method) The
        CORS-safelisted methods are always allowed, regardless of whether they
        are specified in the `AllowMethods` field.

        When the `AllowMethods` field is configured with one or more methods, the
        gateway must return the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header
        which value is present in the `AllowMethods` field.

        If the HTTP method of the `Access-Control-Request-Method` request header
        is not included in the list of methods specified by the response header
        `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, it will present an error on the client
        side.

        The `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header can only use `*`
        wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

        When the `AllowCredentials` field is true and `AllowMethods` field
        specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must specify one HTTP method
        in the value of the Access-Control-Allow-Methods response header. The
        value of the header `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` is same as the
        `Access-Control-Request-Method` header provided by the client. If the
        header `Access-Control-Request-Method` is not included in the request,
        the gateway will omit the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header,
        instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. A Gateway implementation may
        choose to add implementation-specific default methods.

        Support: Extended
    allowOrigins : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        AllowOrigins indicates whether the response can be shared with requested
        resource from the given `Origin`.

        The `Origin` consists of a scheme and a host, with an optional port, and
        takes the form `<scheme>://<host>(:<port>)`.

        Valid values for scheme are: `http` and `https`.

        Valid values for port are any integer between 1 and 65535 (the list of
        available TCP/UDP ports). Note that, if not included, port `80` is
        assumed for `http` scheme origins, and port `443` is assumed for `https`
        origins. This may affect origin matching.

        The host part of the origin may contain the wildcard character `*`. These
        wildcard characters behave as follows:

        * `*` is a greedy match to the _left_, including any number of
          DNS labels to the left of its position. This also means that
          `*` will include any number of period `.` characters to the
          left of its position.
        * A wildcard by itself matches all hosts.

        An origin value that includes _only_ the `*` character indicates requests
        from all `Origin`s are allowed.

        When the `AllowOrigins` field is configured with multiple origins, it
        means the server supports clients from multiple origins. If the request
        `Origin` matches the configured allowed origins, the gateway must return
        the given `Origin` and sets value of the header
        `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` same as the `Origin` header provided by the
        client.

        The status code of a successful response to a "preflight" request is
        always an OK status (i.e., 204 or 200).

        If the request `Origin` does not match the configured allowed origins,
        the gateway returns 204/200 response but doesn't set the relevant
        cross-origin response headers. Alternatively, the gateway responds with
        403 status to the "preflight" request is denied, coupled with omitting
        the CORS headers. The cross-origin request fails on the client side.
        Therefore, the client doesn't attempt the actual cross-origin request.

        The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header can only use `*`
        wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

        When the `AllowCredentials` field is true and `AllowOrigins` field
        specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must return a single origin
        in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header,
        instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. The value of the header
        `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is same as the `Origin` header provided by
        the client.

        Support: Extended
    exposeHeaders : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        ExposeHeaders indicates which HTTP response headers can be exposed
        to client-side scripts in response to a cross-origin request.

        A CORS-safelisted response header is an HTTP header in a CORS response
        that it is considered safe to expose to the client scripts.
        The CORS-safelisted response headers include the following headers:
        `Cache-Control`
        `Content-Language`
        `Content-Length`
        `Content-Type`
        `Expires`
        `Last-Modified`
        `Pragma`
        (See https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-safelisted-response-header-name)
        The CORS-safelisted response headers are exposed to client by default.

        When an HTTP header name is specified using the `ExposeHeaders` field,
        this additional header will be exposed as part of the response to the
        client.

        Header names are not case sensitive.

        Multiple header names in the value of the `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`
        response header are separated by a comma (",").

        A wildcard indicates that the responses with all HTTP headers are exposed
        to clients. The `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` response header can only
        use `*` wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is false or omitted.

        Support: Extended
    maxAge : int, default is 5, optional
        MaxAge indicates the duration (in seconds) for the client to cache the
        results of a "preflight" request.

        The information provided by the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` and
        `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response headers can be cached by the
        client until the time specified by `Access-Control-Max-Age` elapses.

        The default value of `Access-Control-Max-Age` response header is 5
        (seconds).

        Note that `Content-Length` has a special behavior, in that the length
        sent must be correct for the actual request to the external authorization
        server - that is, it must reflect the actual number of bytes sent in the

        If a query param is repeated in an HTTP request, the behavior is

    attempts : int, default is Undefined, optional
        Attempts specifies the maximum number of times an individual request
        from the gateway to a backend should be retried.

        If the maximum number of retries has been attempted without a successful
        response from the backend, the Gateway MUST return an error.

        When this field is unspecified, the number of times to attempt to retry
        a backend request is implementation-specific.

        Support: Extended
    backoff : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Backoff specifies the minimum duration a Gateway should wait between
        retry attempts and is represented in Gateway API Duration formatting.

        For example, setting the `rules[].retry.backoff` field to the value
        `100ms` will cause a backend request to first be retried approximately
        100 milliseconds after timing out or receiving a response code configured
        to be retryable.

        An implementation MAY use an exponential or alternative backoff strategy
        for subsequent retry attempts, MAY cap the maximum backoff duration to
        some amount greater than the specified minimum, and MAY add arbitrary
        jitter to stagger requests, as long as unsuccessful backend requests are
        not retried before the configured minimum duration.

        If a Request timeout (`rules[].timeouts.request`) is configured on the
        route, the entire duration of the initial request and any retry attempts
        MUST not exceed the Request timeout duration. If any retry attempts are
        still in progress when the Request timeout duration has been reached,
        these SHOULD be canceled if possible and the Gateway MUST immediately
        return a timeout error.

        If a BackendRequest timeout (`rules[].timeouts.backendRequest`) is
        configured on the route, any retry attempts which reach the configured
        BackendRequest timeout duration without a response SHOULD be canceled if
        possible and the Gateway should wait for at least the specified backoff
        duration before attempting to retry the backend request again.

        If a BackendRequest timeout is _not_ configured on the route, retry
        attempts MAY time out after an implementation default duration, or MAY
        remain pending until a configured Request timeout or implementation
        default duration for total request time is reached.

    Attributes
    ----------
    backendRequest : str, default is Undefined, optional
        BackendRequest specifies a timeout for an individual request from the gateway
        to a backend. This covers the time from when the request first starts being
        sent from the gateway to when the full response has been received from the backend.

        Setting a timeout to the zero duration (e.g. "0s") SHOULD disable the timeout
        completely. Implementations that cannot completely disable the timeout MUST
        instead interpret the zero duration as the longest possible value to which
        the timeout can be set.

        An entire client HTTP transaction with a gateway, covered by the Request timeout,
        may result in more than one call from the gateway to the destination backend,
        for example, if automatic retries are supported.

        The value of BackendRequest must be a Gateway API Duration string as defined by
        GEP-2257.  When this field is unspecified, its behavior is implementation-specific;
        when specified, the value of BackendRequest must be no more than the value of the
        Request timeout (since the Request timeout encompasses the BackendRequest timeout).

        Support: Extended
    request : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Request specifies the maximum duration for a gateway to respond to an HTTP request.
        If the gateway has not been able to respond before this deadline is met, the gateway
        MUST return a timeout error.

        For example, setting the `rules.timeouts.request` field to the value `10s` in an
        `HTTPRoute` will cause a timeout if a client request is taking longer than 10 seconds
        to complete.

        Setting a timeout to the zero duration (e.g. "0s") SHOULD disable the timeout
        completely. Implementations that cannot completely disable the timeout MUST
        instead interpret the zero duration as the longest possible value to which
        the timeout can be set.

        This timeout is intended to cover as close to the whole request-response transaction
        as possible although an implementation MAY choose to start the timeout after the entire
        request stream has been received instead of immediately after the transaction is
        initiated by the client.

        The value of Request is a Gateway API Duration string as defined by GEP-2257. When this

        Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
        boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly

        Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
        generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.


        ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
        routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from

        listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
        select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
        networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
        as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
        and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
        must match both specified values.


        When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
        Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
        the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.


        Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
        Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly

        For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as

        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
        from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully

        both specified values.
        * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
        are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
        both specified values.

        Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
        If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is

        When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
        For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
        least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
