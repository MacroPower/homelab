## Prune will automatically delete resources that are no longer part of the
## desired state, i.e. those that were removed from Git.
##
## Self-heal will automatically re-create or correct resources that have drifted
## from the desired state, i.e. those that were removed or changed in the
## cluster but still exist in Git.
##
## It can be useful to disable pruning and self-healing in a development
## environment, so that changes made locally are not reverted immediately.
## However, it is important to re-enable these features in production
## environments to ensure that the desired state is always maintained.
## If the desired state is not well understood, it could be useful to disable
## pruning to avoid accidental deletion of resources.
