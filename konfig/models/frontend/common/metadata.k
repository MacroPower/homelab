schema Metadata:
    """Metadata is the base schema of all models, which contains data
    that helps uniquely identify the object.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name: str, default is Undefined, required
        The name of the resource.
        Name must be unique within a namespace. It's required when creating
        resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the
        generation of an appropriate name automatically.
        Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration
        definition. Cannot be updated. More info:
        http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
    labels: {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional.
        Labels is a map of string keys and values that can be used to
        organize and categorize (scope and select) objects.
        May match selectors of replication controllers and services.
        More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels
    annotations: {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional.
        Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a
        resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve
        arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved
        when modifying objects.
        More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
    namespace: str, default is Undefined, optional.
        Namespaces are intended for use in environments with many users spread
        across multiple teams, or projects.
        For clusters with a few to tens of users, you should not need to create
        or think about namespaces at all. Start using namespaces when you need the features they provide.
