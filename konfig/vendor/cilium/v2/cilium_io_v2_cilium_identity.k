schema CiliumIdentity:
    """
    CiliumIdentity is a CRD that represents an identity managed by Cilium. It is intended as a backing store for identity allocation, acting as the global coordination backend, and can be used in place of a KVStore (such as etcd). The name of the CRD is the numeric identity and the labels on the CRD object are the kubernetes sourced labels seen by cilium. This is currently the only label source possible when running under kubernetes. Non-kubernetes labels are filtered but all labels, from all sources, are places in the SecurityLabels field. These also include the source and are used to define the identity. The labels under metav1.ObjectMeta can be used when searching for CiliumIdentity instances that include particular labels. This can be done with invocations such as: 
     kubectl get ciliumid -l 'foo=bar'

    Attributes
    ----------
    apiVersion : str, default is "cilium.io/v2", required
        APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
    kind : str, default is "CiliumIdentity", required
        Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
    metadata : v1.ObjectMeta, default is Undefined, required
        metadata
    security_labels : {str:str}, default is Undefined, required
        SecurityLabels is the source-of-truth set of labels for this identity.
